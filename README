TCP++, A FREE TCP SERVERS SOFTWARE.

Welcome to TCP++!

TCP++ is a free software that you can use to create your TCP server.
This file will help you to create one.

NOTE: If you're on Windows you must download Cygwin's DLL files.

HOW I CREATE A TCP SERVER?
First, execute the TCP++ version for your OS.

Next, put your IP address and choose a communication port.
Now your computer is a server, you can connect other computers with telnet
or netcat.

Example: telnet 192.168.1.20 55555

Clients can send messages and the server can see messages from clients.
Many clients can connect to a server.

ENJOY!
